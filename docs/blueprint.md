## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich, saturated dark blue (#191970) to evoke feelings of professionalism and trust, referencing the existing brand color.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated blue (#D3E2EF), a lighter tint of the primary, creating a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant red-orange (#FF4500), analogous to blue and a complement to the brand image, used for calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif similar to Didot, for headings to create an elegant, fashionable feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for body text, because 'Playfair' is not suitable for long blocks of text.
- Use clear and simple icons for navigation and categories, ensuring they are easily understandable.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout to organize content effectively and create a professional aesthetic.
- Incorporate subtle animations on page transitions and hover effects to engage users.
